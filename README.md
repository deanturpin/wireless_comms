# UMTS (3G)
* 3GPP
* W-CDMA (wideband)
* 2100 MHz
* 5 MHz = 2Mb/s
* Each cell uses 1.8-12 kb/s

# U-NII
* 5.150 - 5.925

# Bluetooth
* 2.4 to 2.485 GHz
* A computer chip selects the 79 channels of the ISM band automatically to prevent eavesdropping and interference with other equipment. Though your cordless phone uses the same frequency band, Bluetooth avoids channels already in use. Through a technology called adaptive frequency hopping, Bluetooth changes channels 1,600 time per second to make the best use of local radio condition
* 1600 Hz = 0.000625

# LTE (4G)
* Long term evolution
* OFDMA
* 20 MHz
* UK: 700 (Europe), 800, 900, 1800, 2100, 2600 MHz
* 800 MHz 4G has longer range but smaller capacityA
* 800 - 5 and 10 MHz blocks
* 2600 - 35 MHz blocks
* MIMO
* Coordinated multipoint
* HetNet - heterogenous network
